 # **üßÆ Mathematical Constants**
 
 A [mathematical constant](glossary://mathematical%20constant) is a key number whose value is fixed by an unambiguous definition, often referred to by a symbol, to facilitate using it across multiple mathematical problems.
 
 Examples of these numbers include [œÄ](glossary://pi), [‚ÑÆ](glossary://e) and [œï](glossary://Golden%20Ratio). Each first discovered by **Archimedes of Syracuse**, **Leonhard Euler**, and **Euclid** respectively.

 ### œÄ
 - Note:
    [œÄ](glossary://pi) is defined as the ratio between the diameter of a circle and its circumference.
 
 Ancient civilisations like the Egyptians and Babylonians required approximations of [œÄ](glossary://pi) for practical computations. The Greek mathematician **Archimedes** created an algorithm to calculate [œÄ](glossary://pi) with arbitrary accuracy.
 
 ### e
 [e](glossary://e), also known as **Euler's Number** can be calculated in many unique ways: lim‚Çô‚Üí‚àû (1 + 1/n)‚Åø, ‚àë1/n!. **Leonhard Euler** discovered the number e and calculated its value to 23 decimal places. Jacob Bernoulli also discovered the constant while studying compound interest in 1683.
 
 [e](glossary://e) has applications in a wide variety of fields including finance, probability, and calculus.
 
 
 ### Golden Ratio (œï)
 
 - Note:
    Two quantities are in the [golden ratio](glossary://GoldenRatio) if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.
 
 Greek mathematician **Euclid** provided the first written explanation of how to find the [golden ratio](glossary://GoldenRatio) in 300 BC.
 
 The [golden ratio](glossary://GoldenRatio) appears in some patterns in nature, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other plant parts. The golden ratio is regularly used in architecture, art, design, music, and nature.
