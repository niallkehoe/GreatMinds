 # **ðŸ–¥ Alan Turing**
 
 **Alan Turing**, widely regarded as the 'father' of modern computer science and [artificial intelligence](glossary://artificial%20intelligence), was born in London in 1912.
 
 He graduated from King's College, Cambridge with first-class honours in mathematics. Shortly after graduating, Turing moved to Princeton University to complete his PhD.
 
 He had a revolutionary idea of a machine that could convert thought processes into numbers. The machine would read a series of ones and zeros from tape which described the steps needed to perform a task. This principle is the foundation of all modern computers.
 
 However, in 1939, with the outbreak of [WWII](glossary://WWII), Turing returned home to England to join the [Government Code and Cypher School](glossary://Government%20Code%20and%20Cypher%20School) at [Bletchley Park](glossary://Bletchley%20Park).
 
 - Experiment:
    Please open the Live View in Full Screen. Tap the [Enigma machine](glossary://Enigma%20Machine) to open the box, then press the front of the box to wire the [plugboard](glossary://plugboard). After wiring the plugboard, type your message using the replica keyboard. Then, press the chat bubble to see how Turing broke the code.
 
 ### ðŸ“  Enigma
 
[Enigma](glossary://Enigma%20Machine) was a cypher device employed extensively by Nazi Germany during [WWII](glossary://WWII), in all branches of the German military.
 
 It worked allowing a current to flow when a key was pressed through wires connected in the [plugboard](glossary://plugboard), through a complex series of rotors which had a mesh of interconnected wiring, back through the rotors for a second time, back through the [plugboard](glossary://plugboard) and then lights a letter's bulb on the lampboard, which would be recorded for later transmission.
 
 Each unit had 5 rotors to pick from but the machine could only hold 3 at a time. The machine allowed any of the 26 [plugboard](glossary://plugboard) connections to be paired using any of its 10 wires.
 
 When a key is pressed, the rightmost rotor rotated by 1 letter. A rotor rotates by 1 letter every time the rotor to its right completes one full rotation.

 - Note:
    While the Polish had fleeting success at breaking the German Enigma codes, their systems exploited procedural failures by operators; these security holes were promptly patched by the Germans in 1940.
 
 ### ðŸ¤– [The Bombe](glossary://Bombe)
 
Turing and his team built a code-breaking machine known as the [Bombe](glossary://Bombe) whose decryption process is described in my Interactive Scene. Amazingly within a few months, the machine could consistently break German Naval Enigma, the most complex kind implemented by the Germans.
 
 From early 1940 onwards, Turing passed decrypted intelligence to the British Army undoubtedly helping to turn the tide of the war.
 
 ### His Death
Sadly, Alan Turing was prosecuted after the war and faced with imprisonment because he was gay. Hounded by the authorities, he committed suicide on June 7th 1954.
 
 A poisoned half-eaten apple was found next to him, which some believe to be the inspiration for the Apple logo(ï£¿).
