 # **ðŸš€ Special Relativity**
 
 The **special theory of relativity** is a scientific theory regarding the relationship between space and time. **Albert Einstein's** theory was based on 2 postulates:
 - The laws of physics are invariant in all inertial frames of reference (frames of reference with no acceleration).
 - The **speed of light** in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.
 
 Einstein used **thought experiments** to visualise his ideas. One of his thought experiments involved a person standing near a train track when two lightning bolts strook the track at the same time 100m apart. Since the lightning bolts were equal distances from the person, the person would see them as simultaneous.
 
 However, if the person was standing at the centre of a train moving at close to the speed of light, the beam of light from the lightning they were travelling towards would reach them first. The light from the lightning bolt the train was travelling away from would take longer to reach the train.
 
 This discovery flew in the face of [Newtonian Mechanics](glossary://newtonianmechanics) which thought that time was absolute for all frames of reference.
 
 - Experiment:
    Once you've added the thought experiment to the AR Scene, Remember to touch the train to begin the simulation.
 
 ## **Time Dilation**
 
 Another thought experiment involving a train travelling at near the **speed of light** further built on this idea. In this example, a person on the train shines a torch at a mirror inside the train. To the person on the train, the light travelled straight to the mirror and back.
 
 However, to an outside observer, the light was moving with the train horizontally and so had horizontal velocity. Since the speed of light is constant, the speed in the z-direction was reduced, meaning the light took longer to reach the mirror and return. This meant that the inside of the train experienced a slower time relative to the observer.
 
 Meaning those travelling on the train aged at a slower rate than those outside!
