This year I decided to make an educational playground book which discussed topics from Mathematics, Technology and Computing. The project focuses on the work of Alan Turing, Albert Einstein, Leonhard Euler and more.

Each chapter breaks down a concept/invention from the past and tries to give an intuition to how they work. Chapter One tackles Mathematical Constants (Ï€, e, and the Golden Ratio), chapter two brings a WWII Enigma Machine to life and explains how the code was cracked, and chapter three demonstrates a thought experiment Einstein used when discovering special relativity.

## Frameworks

I used ARKit, SceneKit, SwiftUI, UIKit, RealityKit, Reality Composer, SpriteKit and AVFoundation to create my playground book.
